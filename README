MIT Kerberos GSS-API Java Interface

NOTICE: This branch (jgss) is under development and may not build or run 
correctly. Please use the master branch for a stable build and more complete
documentation.

This package provides a Java GSS-API wrapper around the the MIT Kerberos
GSS-API native library, conforming to the GSS-API Java bindings via RFC 5653. 
One of the main goals of this interface is to bring GSS-API functionality to 
the Android platform, which previous to this project had lacked both Kerberos
and GSS-API support. Using this interface, Android developers are able to use
GSS-API functionality in their Android NDK applications.

For a working example of an Android NDK application using this GSS-API 
interface, please look at the "Kerberos Android NDK" package hosted on 
GitHub: https://github.com/cconlon/kerberos-android-ndk.

===========================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:

You must have SWIG installed on your development machine in order to
build this GSS-API wrapper. The Java GSS-API bindings are wrapped around a
native SWIG-generated layer that then in turn interfaces to the native 
Kerberos GSS-API library. To download and install SWIG, please see
the project homepage at http://www.swig.org/. This project has been developed
using SWIG version 1.3.40 running on Linux.

To use this interface in your Android NDK application, you need to
include cross-compiled versions of the MIT Kerberos libraries for Android
in your project. For details about these libraries and an example of how to
include them in your project, please see the "Kerberos Android NDK" 
application on GitHub: https://github.com/cconlon/kerberos-android-ndk.

If you want to rebuild the pre-built Kerberos libraries, please use the
android-config.sh shell script found in the above noted project. This will 
allow the MIT Kerberos libraries to be cross-compiled for the Android 
platform. More detailed instructions can be found in the script comments.

===========================================================================
PROJECT DESIGN:

This project is made up of several layers, most of which are invisible to
the end Java API user. The high-level layers are visualized in the following
figure. The native MIT GSS-API library is wrapped using SWIG into a 
temporary C/Java layer (LAYER 1). This first layer may be used directly, but
is more tedious and less standardized than the org.ietf.jgss interface. A 
top-level Java API is then wrapped around the SWIG-generated layer. This 
top-level Java API (LAYER 2) conforms to the org.ietf.jgss interface 
specification, and is located in the edu.mit.jgss package.

            -----> (LAYER 2) Java GSS-API layer (org.ietf.jgss, edu.mit.jgss)
            |
    -----> (LAYER 1) SWIG-generated wrapper layer handling C-Java interface
    |
Native MIT Kerberos/GSS-API libraries

===========================================================================
SWIG WRAPPER DESIGN (LAYER 1):

This wrapper contains a few files which are used by SWIG to generate 
the Layer 1 Java GSS-API interface. A short description of those files along 
with descriptions of some of the key directory structures in this package are
below.

gsswrapper.i
------------
This is the SWIG interface file. It contains all of the code and typemaps 
needed by SWIG to generate the corresponding Layer 1 Java interface for the 
MIT GSS-API library. 

gsswrapper_wrap.h
-----------------

This is a header file that provides function prototypes for the SWIG-generated 
C wrapper functions. If functions are changed in gsswrapper.i, this file 
should be updated to match accordingly.

src/java/edu/mit/jgss/swig
--------------------------

Location of the SWIG-generated .java files which provide Layer 1 Java access 
to the native MIT GSS-API library using a similar interface to GSS-API C 
bindings.

src/java/edu/mit/jgss
---------------------

Location of the Layer 2 MIT Java GSS-API implementation of RFC 5653.

src/java/org/ietf/jgss
----------------------

Location of the Layer 2 Java GSS-API interface files as described by the 
IETF in RFC 5653.

===========================================================================
BUILDING:

The Java GSS-API interface can currently be built for use on a standard 
desktop environment. Android support will come in the near future.

Desktop Environment
-------------------
To build the GSS-API interface and examples on a desktop environment, 

(1) cd to the directory containing gsswrapper.i and edit the JavaBuild.sh file 
    to match your system's Java and Kerberos configuration.
    
    NOTE: If building on OS X, the Java include directory will most likely be
    something similar to:

    /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/Headers

    For OS X, you'll also need to change the extension of the shared library
    being compiled by SWIG to .dylib (libgsswrapper.dylib) instead of .so
    which is used by standard Linux environments.

    If building on Linux, the Java include directory may be similar to:

    /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include

(2) Verify that the library being loaded by the SWIG wrapper (gsswrapper.i)
    is the correct one. This should be the name of the library being created
    by the JavaBuild.sh script.

(3) Run ./JavaBuild.sh
    
    This will run the correct SWIG command, create libgsswrapper.so (.dylib) 
    as well as generate and compile all the necessary JNI and Java files 
    needed for the interface and examples.

(4) You may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include paths to the MIT Kerberos 
    libraries on your system as well as the location of the SWIG-generated 
    library. For example, something similar to:

    Linux:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:
        /home/myuser/kerberos-java-gssapi/

    Mac:
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:
        /Users/myuser/kerberos-java-gssapi/

(5) Build the .java file using the ant build system uisng the following
    command issued from the package root directory. Compiled .class files
    will be placed into the ./build and ./examples/build directories.

    ant

(6) To easily clean up the package and return it to its original state, run
    the following commands from the package root directory. This will delete
    all compiled Java source files and the SWIG-generated .java files located
    in src/java/edu/mit/jgss/swig and native/.

    ant clean
    ant cleanswig

===========================================================================
NOTES:

(1) Because the org.ietf.jgss package already exists on most desktop Java
    installations, it is necessary to set the bootclasspath variable when
    running applications built with MIT's org.ietf.jgss package. To see an
    example of this, please reference the test example scripts in ./examples
    (ie server.sh, client.sh).

    When using the bootclasspath, the MIT org.ietf.jgss classes are treated
    as system classes. All system classes will only lookup shared libraries
    in $JAVA_HOME/bin. As such, one of several actions needs to be done
    when using this package with bootclasspath:

    a) Install gsswrapper.so library into $JAVA_HOME/bin
    b) Set the sun.boot.library.path to include the gsswrapper.so library
       path. The syntax is:

       java -Dsun.boot.library.path=$JAVA_HOME/bin:/path/to/gsswrapper.so

    The need to use bootclasspath should not be necessary on Android, as
    the platform doesn't have an existing org.ietf.jgss package installed.

(2) The Layer 2 MIT GSS-API Java implementation does not have support for
    the SPI framework that is specified in RFC 5653. This framework is
    specified as optional in the RFC. The current edu.mit.jgss package
    wraps directlly around the Layer 1 SWIG Java GSS-API 
    package (edu.mit.jgss.swig).
